            HOWL aims to include as many as possible of the different ‘voices’
            of women’s liberation in the UK. We didn’t all agree on how women’s
            liberation could be achieved, what feminism actually means, who it
            includes, and who it sometimes excludes. Many of the differences and
            difficulties which arose in the early years of the movement focussed
            on issues of exclusion based on institutionalized racism, class, and
            sexual identities, to name a few. As well, different explanations
            about women’s oppression and different political positions about the
            tasks at hand and ahead arose. Many women identified as radical
            feminists, or socialist feminists, or black feminists, or lesbian
            feminists, or revolutionary feminists - and there were more. We
            intend to include it all! We want the whole picture; history
            deserves the broad picture. However - while HOWL is committed to
            providing space for all of this, we want to avoid personal attacks
            and accusation. Where they arose, schisms, struggles, even
            bitterness will be included. But, gratuitous attacks on individuals
            will not be included.
