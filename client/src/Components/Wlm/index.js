          The Women’s Liberation Movement (WLM) in the UK arose out of the rich
          mix of 1960s social upheavals and events around the world. Here in the
          UK, trade union women were putting equal-pay back on the agenda,
          Vietnam War protests were pulling 1000s of people out onto the
          streets, the Gay Liberation Front formed and Black Power
          demonstrations took on racism. Women were engaged in all these areas -
          and more.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the US women had already started to band together, making demands,
          creating trouble - and sending messages across oceans where they were
          eagerly received. We took all these influences and experiences and
          started an incendiary and creative conversation among ourselves which
          quickly flamed into the UK Women’s Liberation Movement.
          <br />
          <br />
          Women gathered in small groups (later consciousness-raising groups) to
          share experiences collectively. At the same time the need to act, to
          challenge, to change, led to demands, campaigns and projects. All
          through the 1970s and 80s the movement’s vitality sustained and
          transformed 1000s of women’s lives and influenced the whole of
          society. Through this period, deep thinking took place about
          everything to do with women’s roles, activism, the patriarchy, and our
          aims as a movement. The differences and divisions between women also
          led to difficult and sometimes painful struggles. Who said liberation
          was ever ‘plain sailing’!?
          <br />
          <br />
          After some years of relative quiescence in the 1990s, new ‘waves’ of
          feminists have made themselves known. Much has been accomplished -
          much more is needed.
