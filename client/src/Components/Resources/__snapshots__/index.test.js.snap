        The Women’s Liberation Movement was a major factor in social change, from the groups and demonstrations of the 1970s to the activist policy work of the 1980s and 1990s. The 21st century feminist revival is a strong and vibrant force today. In our collections you can find out where ideas began, and how feminist politics were put into practice. The Feminist Archive has the original sources.
